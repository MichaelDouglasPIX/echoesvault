# 🎮 EchoesVault – Game Library
EchoesVault is a game-management platform that lets users curate their own game library, track wishlists, connect with friends, and receive real-time event-driven updates. The name reflects the idea of echoes (events) propagating through the system, much like hidden clues and secrets inside games.
